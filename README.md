yes is me


Hello! I'm a university student with a passion for programming and technology. I'm currently learning various foundational programming languages and exploring different fields to contribute to open-source projects, grow through hands-on experience, and make a meaningful impact on society.

Goals

🚀Web Development

HTML & CSS: Understanding the structure and style of web pages.
JavaScript: Building dynamic and interactive websites, with a focus on frameworks like React, Vue.js, or Angular for front-end development.
Node.js (Optional): Exploring full-stack development to create server-side applications using JavaScript.
Back-End Languages & Databases:
Python (Flask, Django) or Ruby (Ruby on Rails).
SQL and database management.

🚀App Development

·Java / Kotlin for Android development.
·Swift for iOS development.
·Cross-Platform Development: Learning Flutter (Dart) or React Native for developing apps that work across platforms.

🚀AI Programming

·Python as a primary language for AI and machine learning.
·Utilizing frameworks like NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch.
·Strengthening my understanding of mathematics relevant to AI, such as linear algebra, calculus, and probability.


Learning Path
1.Begin with fundamental Web Development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
2.Advance to App Development (based on specific platform interests).
3.Focus on AI Programming to explore machine learning and deep learning using Python.
